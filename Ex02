2. As a neutron has no charge it is not effected by a magnetic field.
3. Tau is the heaviest lepton with 1777 MeV/c^2. For quarks i found the bottom quark with 4.19 GeV but The masses should not be taken too seriously
  because the confinement of quarks implies that we cannot isolate them to measure their masses in a direct way. The masses must be implied indirectly from scattering experiments.

4.proton, stable subatomic particle that has a positive charge equal in magnitude to a unit of electron charge and a rest mass of 1.67262 × 10−27 kg,
  which is 1,836 times the mass of an electron.
5. with the formula: gamma = c/(c^2-c^2)^(1/2) transformed to (c^2-c^2/gamma^2)^(1/2)=v the speed is 8321 m/s
6. Fermions are one of the two fundamental classes of particles and have a half integer spin.
   Bosons are one of the two fundamental classes of particles and have a integer spin.
   Leptons are fermions that not interact via the strong interaction. THere are three charged leptons and three not charged ones.
   Hadrons are strongly interacting composite particles. The consist of two or three quarks and called baryons for two and mesons for three quarks.
   Baryons are hadrons with three quarks and also fermions. The two most known are the protons and neutrons.
   Mesons are hadrons with two quarks and also bosons. The normally consist of a valence quark and the valence antiquark.

8. As it is known that energy and mass are interchangeable the main mass comes from the motion and confinement of quarks and gluons.
  more specific from the quark condensate ( ∼9%), the quark energy ( ∼32%), the gluonic field strength energy ( ∼37%), and the anomalous gluonic contribution ( ∼23%).

9. The mean lifetime of a muon is 2,196 9811 · 10−6 s. The are formed by the collision of cosmic rays with particles of the earth atmosphere and travel at relativistic speeds.
   That way they are able to penetrate tens of meters into rocks or walls before being absorped or deflected. In that way they reach laboratories.

11. Classicaly 10 half lifes are considers enough so that most of the particles are gone. If the mass of a C-14 is calculated in gram that would be 2.3*10^-23 g.
    The moment the half life would leave less than this mass all C-14 are decayed. This is the moment after 93 half lifes with 1.4*10^-23 g left.
