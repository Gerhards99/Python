3. Tau is the heaviest lepton with 1777 MeV/c^2. For quarks i found the bottom quark with 4.19 GeV but The masses should not be taken too seriously
  because the confinement of quarks implies that we cannot isolate them to measure their masses in a direct way. The masses must be implied indirectly from scattering experiments.

4.proton, stable subatomic particle that has a positive charge equal in magnitude to a unit of electron charge and a rest mass of 1.67262 × 10−27 kg,
  which is 1,836 times the mass of an electron.

6. Fermions are one of the two fundamental classes of particles and have a half integer spin.
   Bosons are one of the two fundamental classes of particles and have a integer spin.
   Leptons are fermions that not interact via the strong interaction. THere are three charged leptons and three not charged ones.
   Hadrons are strongly interacting composite particles. The consist of two or three quarks and called baryons for two and mesons for three quarks.
   Baryons are hadrons with three quarks and also fermions. The two most known are the protons and neutrons.
   Mesons are hadrons with two quarks and also bosons. The normally consist of a valence quark and the valence antiquark.
